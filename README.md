### Gear-up for a new concept in mechanical power transmission for renewable energy
#### *Note: This page as it stands represents an MVP for sharing - significant upgdaes are planned!*

Spherebox is the working title of a mechanism to efficiently gear-up (or down) rotary motion at ratios of 20:1 or more in a single stage, using spherical geometry and magnets.

We believe it is "novel" in the sense of an invention, but we want to "open-source it" and share it with the world rather than go through the patent process.  Partly, because if it turns out to be genuinely useful, we don't think it should be locked behind a patent

Key features:
* No sliding contact - less friction, less wear --> Less maintainance **+ more output power?**
* "Soft" backlash, from magnetic force transmission:
  * No risk of impact-loading gear teeth if the load direction changes sign -->  Less maintainance
  * Lower dynamic loads --> Less structural overhead
* "Overload protection" - the magnetic force transmission will act as a resetable mechanical fuse --> less structural overhead
